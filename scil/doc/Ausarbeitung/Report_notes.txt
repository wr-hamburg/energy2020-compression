Introduction:

- What is data compression
- Compression maximizes storage capacity
- Needed in scientific and commercial contexts
- Example of data peaking at Cern or archiving climate data
- Difference between lossy and lossless
- SCIL as a user friendly interface
- User can provide parameters
- Based on users input, SCIL will choose best compression method automatically
- Decompressing as simple as a single function call

Design:

- Existing potential of scientific data reduction through combination of
    compression methods in a single library
- Technical review
- Goal of implementing a compression interface that is
    - simple to use
    - extensible
    - data adaptive
    - dynamic

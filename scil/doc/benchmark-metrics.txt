Compression throughput and ratios could depend on:

Data characteristics
    - size of data buffer
    - dimensionality
    - randomness/entropy
    - minimum value
    - maximum value
    - mean
    - median ?
    - std. deviation

User defined compression parameters:
    - absolute/relative error tolerance
    - compression algorithm to use

The compressed buffer consists of a header:
byte CHAIN_LENGTH // the number of compressors to apply.

Then for the first compressor to apply the format looks like:
byte compressor_id // The compressor number as registered in SCIL.
byte * COMPRESSOR_SPECIFIC_HEADER
byte * COMPRESSED DATA

If the chain consists of multiple compressors the final format looks like:

byte CHAIN_LENGTH
byte compressor_id_ALGO1
ALGO1 specific header
